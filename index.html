### *Fiduciary with a difference*

---

#### What is the meaning of *fiduciary*?

**Fiduciary** is derived from the Latin word *fidere*, which means "to trust". In this case, the investment adviser (that's me) has the power and obligation to act for the beneficiary (that's you, or the client) under circumstances which require total *trust*, *good faith* and *honesty*.

In simple English -- your interest comes before mine.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

**Why did I decide to become an investment adviser?**

Three reasons.

1. For years I've made decisions on investments & financial planning for myself, and it worked pretty well. Now, I want to put my experience to good use -- to help clients.

2. Second, I strongly believe that being a fiduciary is the best way to help anyone. Just as doctors look after one's health, financial/investment adviser look after a client's financial well-being. Having more fiduciaries is good for consumers.

3. Third, it is difficult to find a fiduciary. And, it's even more difficult to find a genuine advisor whose investment advice is tailored to the clients' needs.

**Are you always a fiduciary, and will you state that in writing?**

Yes. My relationship with you is purely a fiduciary. The client’s best interest is the key driver of the fiduciary-client relationship. There’s no such thing is part-time fiduciary. Either one is in the fiduciary business, or not. And I’m in the fiduciary business. Your interests comes before mine.

**Does anybody else ever pay you to advise me and, if so, do you earn more to recommend certain products or services?**

No. That would be violation of the law. I’m in the business of giving financial advice, I’m in the fiduciary business. I do not earn commissions on products, and I do not sell products. In order to buy financial products that will be suitable to client, I’ll be happy to recommend some good financial distributors.

**Do you participate in any sales contests or award programs creating incentives to favour particular vendors?**

No. I think having to force clients to buy products is a terrible business model. It leads to mis-selling which will be disastrous in the short- and long-run. The most important thing here is building trust and gaining respect from clients. Sales contests defeats this purpose. Anyway, like I said earlier, I do not sell products. I’m in the fiduciary business.

**Will you itemize all your fees and expenses in writing?**

Sure. My fees include an all encompassing range of investment advice -- right from investment planning to financial planning to general advisory -- and will also include costs involved in servicing the client, and covers everything expected of a client from a financial advisor. Scroll a little more down to see the broad range of advisory services I'm offering.

**Are your fees negotiable?**

No. Typically, the fee is what you would pay to a surgeon or a lawyer for specialised and holistic service. Investment advisory is not a commodity product, it is a specialised service that requires great skill & focus. The idea is to offer value at a given price point, to foster lasting relationships, to help the clients realise their goals, become financially literate, become more self-aware, and understand their investments and own self better. Would you ever haggle with a doctor or surgeon?

**How do you charge your clients?**

The quantum of fee is directly proportional to the complexity & requirements of the advisory. It is not a one-size-fits-all type of fee/advisory. What I do is very specialised, measured, holistic & customised, and the fee reflects the value I will be offering to the client as a fiduciary. Being a fiduciary means I'm always available to sort out clients' queries and offer advice is that is needed. Being a fiduciary also means I will handhold & assist a client throughout. At the end of the day, the beneficiary of the advice is the client.

**Can you tell me about your conflicts of interest, orally and in writing?**

Of course. Every advisor, regardless of business model or form of compensation, will have some conflicts. My motivation is fairly simple: I want you to be my client for a long time, and pay me every year. I don’t care if you take money from your portfolio to buy something or invest elsewhere, because it is your prerogative and you decide what to do with your money. My job is to give you the best advice possible to achieve your objectives, whether it is capital protection or wealth generation, or whatever is that you seek to achieve. My job is to aid your decision making and make it easier for you to execute your ideas. My advice will help you become more self-aware & financial savvy. I could scale up and generate more income, which is a potential conflict. But, at present, I like operating on my own and looking after the interests of few cherished clients. This approach works best for both clients and myself.

**Do you earn fees as adviser to a private fund or other investments that you may recommend to clients?**

I do not serve as an adviser to any third party product originator. I could recommend such products based on the client’s profile and check if the it is suitable to the client’s temperament and investment goals. However, I do not sell products or earn any commissions from any product originator. Like I said earlier, I'm in the fiduciary business.

**Do you pay referral fees to generate new clients?**

No. I have good relationships with many advisors, distributors, lawyers, chartered accountants, asset managers, and potential clients. Sometimes they might refer clients to me. Sometimes, I refer clients to them. But nothing is exchanged between us.

**Do you focus solely on investment management, or do you also advise on taxes, estates and retirement, budgeting and debt management, and insurance?**

I provide the following advisory services:
- Mutual funds
- Tax planning
- Debt counselling
- Insurance planning
- Equity & derivatives
- Alternative investments
- Newsletters & commentary
- Portfolio management schemes (PMS)
- Investment planning & asset allocation
- Comprehensive Personal Financial Planning
- General investment & financial advisory

**Do you earn fees for referring clients to specialists like estate attorneys or insurance agents?**

As a fiduciary, if there is something that I do not know, particularly in specialised areas of law, I will refer clients to a third party whom I feel will service the client better than I will. There could be a collaboration of sorts to help the client. However, nothing is exchanged between third parties and myself. Remember, I'm a fiduciary.

**What is your investment philosophy?**

Each person’s investment philosophy will depend on his/her personality, personal beliefs, and temparament. Mine is very simple – I personally believe that less is more; I believe in holding a concentrated portfolio of assets for long periods of time, which I believe can deliver exemplary returns; I believe one should rebalance their portfolios once in a while in order to attune to current market conditions and keep investment goals aligned; This being said, I also strongly believe in having an open mind to be receptive to different investment approaches, given the costant evolution the global economy & markets. Thus, it is important to combine different approaches for the client’s benefit. This is one of the hardest part of investment advisory, and one that I enjoy the most.

**Do you believe in technical analysis or market timing?**

For some investors this approach works very well. While I'm mostly a fundamental investor, I believe there will be certain situations in the markets that will warrant technical analysis approach. I have tried it a few times and it seems to work just fine. But I haven't tried it substantially enough to endorse it over other approaches. As far as market timing is considered, I believe in it because your future returns is a function of how much you paid for any asset. If you buy an overpriced asset, the chances that your future returns will be less will be far greater, and vice versa. It's common sense.

**Do you believe you can beat the market?**

There are some investment managers who possess alpha, or market-beating skills, but it is incredibly difficult to beat the market for sustained periods of time. These investment managers are rare and difficult to spot well in advance. Inevitably, it boils down to timing and loads of luck. That being said, I do not believe in comparing one’s portfolio returns to the market returns, or anyone else's. While I believe in absolute positive returns, the true metric of investment performance is whether you are achieving your goals, preserving your capital, and whether you can sleep well at night.

**How often do you trade?**

I set aside a small corpus for trading purposes, for my own sanity and happiness. It keeps my grey cells busy. However, as part of my investment advisory, trading is something I do not really advise to clients, unless the client has a strong risk appetite and doesn't mind risking capital. If anyone wishes to trade, I would recommend starting off with a small corpus.

**How do you report investment performance?**

I use a wealth management software and excel that generates all sorts of reports for clients.

**Which professional credentials do you have, and what are their requirements?**

I’m a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), which is the gold standard for wealth management and financial planning. I have also done my MBA with specialisation in finance & economics, and have completed wealth management courses from New York City.

**After inflation, taxes and fees, what is a reasonable estimated return on my portfolio over the long term?**

Of course, it depends. But most people should expect nominal (before-inflation) returns of 9 to 10% on a somewhat balanced portfolio. If you consider taxes & inflation, then you’ll end up somewhere around 5-6%. If you are conservative, you should expect something lower than this. If you are enterprising, you can expect something higher than this, but not without risks and many sleepless nights!

**Who manages your money?**

I do. Actually, I manage my entire family’s assets. It is reasonable to have assets managed by a third party, just to keep my biases in check. For this reason, I have diversified our various portfolios to different asset managers, each having their own unique philosophy. Additionally, a part of our portfolio is directly managed by me. This twin approach helps me achieve two objectives: the first approach helps me refine my own thought process which can help me service clients; the second approach helps me have skin in the game. Both are absolutely critical for understanding the nature of financial advice.

**Why have you designed such a bland, boring, and antiquated website?**

Because it's my choice. It's easier to update without having to hire a website specialist. I do it myself, through Github & Atom. Plus, I like to code on my own. My philosophy is based on simplicity & it is straight to the point. My advisory practice is similar. If you're looking for a flashier website, and complicated advisory, then I'm afraid you will not find it here.
