### *Fiduciary with a difference*

---

**What is the meaning of *fiduciary*?**

**Fiduciary** is derived from the Latin word *fidere*, which means "to trust". In this case, the investment adviser (that's me) has the power and obligation to act for the beneficiary (that's you, or the client) under circumstances which require total *trust*, *good faith* and *honesty*. In simple English -- your interest comes before mine.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Why did I decide to become an investment adviser?**

Three reasons.

1. For years I've made decisions on investments & financial planning for myself, and it worked pretty well. Now, I want to put my experience into good use -- to help you.

2. Second, I strongly believe that being a fiduciary is the best way to help anyone. Just as doctors look after your health, financial/investment adviser look after you financial well-being. Having more fiduciaries is good for consumers.

3. Third, it is difficult to find a fiduciary. And, it's even more difficult to find affordable, good & genuine, investment advice tailored to your needs.

**Are you always a fiduciary, and will you state that in writing?**

Yes. My relationship with you is purely a fiduciary. The client’s best interest is the key driver of the fiduciary-client relationship. There’s no such thing is part-time fiduciary. Either one is in the fiduciary business, or not. And I’m in the fiduciary business. Your interests comes before mine.

**Does anybody else ever pay you to advise me and, if so, do you earn more to recommend certain products or services?**

No. That would be violation of the law. I’m in the business of giving financial advice, I’m in the fiduciary business. Period. I do not earn commissions on products. In fact, I do not sell products. In order to buy financial products that will be suitable to you, I’ll be happy to recommend some good financial distributors to you.

**Do you participate in any sales contests or award programs creating incentives to favour particular vendors?**

No. I think having forcing clients to buy products is a terrible business model. It leads to mis-selling which will be disastrous in the short- and long-run. The most important thing here is building trust and gaining respect from clients. Sales contests defeats this purpose. Anyway, like I said earlier, I do not sell products. I’m in the fiduciary business.

**Will you itemize all your fees and expenses in writing?**

Sure thing. My fees include an all emencompassing range of investment advisory, and will also include costs involved in servicing the client, and covers everything expected of a client from a financial advisor.

**Are your fees negotiable?**

No. Typically, the fee is what you would pay to a surgeon or a lawyer for specialised and holistic service. The idea is to foster a long lasting relationships and help the clients realise their goals, become financially literate, become more self-aware, and manage their investments better. I will be available on call throughout the duration of our agreement, anytime, anywhere, to discuss anything that you have in mind.

**Will you consider charging by the hour or retainer instead of an annual fee based on my assets?**

My business model is flat fee model, and I think it suits the fiduciary model better, and it suits my temparament too. There are plenty of good advisors who do hourly work, if you are looking for a one-time engagement, and I'll be happy to refer you to them.

**Can you tell me about your conflicts of interest, orally and in writing?**

Of course. Every advisor, regardless of business model or form of compensation, will have some conflicts. My motivations are fairly simple: I want you to remain a client for a long time, and pay me every year. I don’t care if you take money from your portfolio to buy something or invest elsewhere, because it is your prerogative and choice what you decide to do with your money. My job is to give you the best advice possible to safeguard your assets and generate wealth. My job is to aid your decision making. My job is to help you become more self-aware & financial savvy. I could scale up and generate more income, which is a potential conflict. But, at present, I like operating on my own and looking after the interests of few cherished clients. This approach works best for both clients and myself.

**Do you earn fees as adviser to a private fund or other investments that you may recommend to clients?**

At the moment, I do not serve as an adviser to any third party product originator. I could recommend such products based on the client’s profile and check if the it is suitable to the client’s temperament and investment goals. However, I do not sell products or earn any commissions from any product originator.

**Do you pay referral fees to generate new clients?**

No. I have good relationships with many advisors and potential clients. Sometimes they might refer clients to me. But nothing is exchanged between us.

**Do you focus solely on investment management, or do you also advise on taxes, estates and retirement, budgeting and debt management, and insurance?**

I provide the following advisory services:
- Equity & derivatives screening
- Alternative investments
- Portfolio management schemes
- Mutual funds
- Insurance planning
- Tax planning
- Debt counselling
- Investment planning & asset allocation
- Comprehensive Personal Financial Planning
- General advisory

**Do you earn fees for referring clients to specialists like estate attorneys or insurance agents?**

As a fiduciary, if there is something that I do not know, particularly in specialised areas of law, I refer clients to a third party whom I feel will service the client better than I will. There could be a collaboration of sorts between other professionals and myself to help the client. However, nothing is exchanged between third parties and myself. This is against regulations.

**What is your investment philosophy?**

Each person’s investment philosophy will depend on their personality, personal beliefs, and temparament. Mine is very simple – I believe that less is more; I believe in holding a concentrated portfolio of assets, for long periods of time, which I believe can deliver exemplary returns to fund my own family's lifestyle; I believe one should rebalance their portfolios once in a while in order to attune to current market conditions and keep investment goals aligned; This being said, I also strongly believe in having an open mind and be receptive to different investment approaches, given the costant evolution and dynamism of the global economy and markets. Thus is important to empathise different approaches for the client’s benefit. This is one of the hardest part of investment advise, and one that I enjoy the most.

**Do you believe in technical analysis or market timing?**

For some investors this approach works very well. While I'm mostly a fundamental investor, I believe there will be certain situations in the markets that will warrant technical analysis approach. I have tried it a few times and it seems to work just fine. But I haven't tried it substantially enough to endorse it over other approaches. As far as market timing is considered, I believe in it plainly because your future returns is a function of how much you paid for any asset. If you buy an overpriced asset, the chances that your future returns will be less will be far greater, and vice versa. It's common sense.

**Do you believe you can beat the market?**

There are some investment managers who possess alpha, or market-beating skills, but it is incredibly difficult to beat the market for sustained periods of time. These investment managers are rare and difficult to spot well in advance. Inevitably, it boils down to luck and timing. That being said, I do not believe in comparing one’s portfolio returns to the market returns, or anyone else's. While I believe in absolute positive returns, the true metric of investment performance is whether you are achieving your goals, preserving your capital, and whether you can sleep well at night.

**How often do you trade?**

I set aside a small corpus for trading purposes, for my own sanity and happiness. It keeps my grey cells busy. However, as part of my investment advisory, trading is something I do not really advise to clients, unless the client has a strong risk appetite. If anyone wants to trade, I would recommend starting off with a small enough corpus, perhaps 1% of their AUM.

**How do you report investment performance?**

I use a software that generates reports. It calculates all the usual metrics of investment performance, particularly IRR which I believe is an important metric. Asset allocation is another important aspect to look at and there are reports for this as well.

**Which professional credentials do you have, and what are their requirements?**

I’m a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), which is the gold standard for wealth management and financial planning. It’s one of the requirements of being an Independent Financial Adviser as per SEBI Regulations. I have also done my MBA with specialisation in finance & economics, and done a few certificate courses in the wealth management.

**After inflation, taxes and fees, what is a reasonable estimated return on my portfolio over the long term?**

Of course, it depends. But most people should expect nominal (before-inflation) returns of 9 to 10% on a somewhat balanced portfolio. If you consider taxes & inflation, then you’ll end up somewhere around 5-6%. If you are conservative, you should expect something lower than this. If you are enterprising, you can expect something higher than this, not without risk and many sleepless nights!

**Who manages your money?**

I do. I actually manage my own family’s assets. I always make sure the client and I have similar wavelengths when it comes to investment temperament. I believe equities are the best wealth generating vehicle out there and I would recommend clients the same, if they had similar risk appetite. However, it is reasonable to have my assets managed by a third party, just to keep my biases in check. My father and I have completely different mindsets & temparament, and I use him as a sounding board for my own investment decisions. That being said, I’m happy managing my own for two reasons: Firstly, managing my own assets helps me have skin in the game; Secondly, it helps me improve and refine the thought processes which can help me in servicing clients. Needless to say, I'm open to having a third-party manage my assets should it become difficult for me to manage. This is more likely to happen as I grow older.
